<p>Q: 
Why would I join your online lesson rather than personal tutoring?</p>

Just because a tutor that can teach does not mean the tutor can teach you well. Our tutors committed sufficient timeslot each week, ensuring your learning to progress. 
Moreover, our systematic teaching method and material are unrivalled by a personal tutor, who usually see it as an unimportant part-time job.</p>
